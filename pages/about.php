<h1>About</h1>
<p>hnng.moe is a link shortener inspired by waa.ai. It was quickly put together in a day  
for the lulz, so if you have any feedback or find any issues with it, feel free to message me 
on <a href="https://twitter.com/roriicon">twitter</a> or 
<a href="mailto:lolisamurai@tfwno.gf">send me an e-mail</a>.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm a programming enthusiast from Italy who loves messing around with code just for the heck of it. 
I usually prefer developing games or software rather than designing websites.
When I learned about .moe domains, I immediately decided to make a .moe url shortener inspired by waa.ai 
and quickly hacked together this simple URL shortening site made in php, html5 and bootstrap. It's my first 
time messing with bootstrap, so bear with my horrible web design skills (&acute;・&omega;・`). Moe domains 
are quite awesome and anyone can get their own at <a target="_blank" href="http://get.moe/">get.moe</a>.</p>
