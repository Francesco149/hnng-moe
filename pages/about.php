<h1>About</h1>

feel free to message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/roriicon">twitter</a> or 
<a href="mailto:lolisamurai@waifu.club">send me an e-mail</a>.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm a programming enthusiast from Italy who loves messing around with code 
just for the heck of it. I usually prefer developing games or software rather 
than designing websites.
When I learned about .moe domains, I immediately decided to make a .moe url 
shortener inspired by waa.ai and quickly hacked together this simple URL 
shortening site made in php, html5 and bootstrap, which I later decided to 
convert to pure html5 and css because I don't support js or any dynamic content 
in browsers. I usually don't do web developing, so bear with my horrible web 
design skills (&acute;・&omega;・`). Moe domains are quite awesome and anyone 
can get their own at <a target="_blank" href="http://get.moe/">get.moe</a>.</p>
